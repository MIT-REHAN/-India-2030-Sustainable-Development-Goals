        <h1>Goal 5: Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls</h1>
      

    <img src="https://i2.wp.com/www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/covid19_response_logo_horizontal_april_2020-01.png?ssl=1"  class="logo0">
    
    “Limited gains in gender equality and women’s rights made over the decades are in danger of being rolled back due to the COVID-19 pandemic,” the UN Secretary-General said in April 2020, urging  governments to put women and girls at the centre of their recovery efforts.<br>
    <br>
    <br>

    Women are not only the hardest hit by this pandemic, they are also the backbone of recovery in communities. Putting women and girls at the centre of economies will fundamentally drive better and more sustainable development outcomes for all, support a more rapid recovery, and place the world back on a footing to achieve the Sustainable Development Goa <br>
<br>
<br>
Every COVID-19 response plans, and every recovery package and budgeting of resources, needs to address the gender impacts of this pandemic. This means: (1) including women and women’s organizations in COVID-19 response planning and decision-making; (2) transforming the inequities of unpaid care work into a new, inclusive care economy that works for everyone; and (3) designing socio-economic plans with an intentional focus on the lives and futures of women and girls.<br>
<br>
<br>
UN Women has developed a rapid and targeted response to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 crisis on women and girls and to ensure that the long-term recovery benefits them, focused on five priorities:<br>
<br>
1.Gender-based violence, including domestic violence, is mitigated and reduced<br>
<br>
<br>
2.Social protection and economic stimulus packages serve women and girls<br>
<br>
<br>
3.People support and practise equal sharing of care work <Br>
    <br>
    <br>
4.Women and girls lead and participate in COVID-19 response planning and decision-making
<br>
<br>

5.Data and coordination mechanisms include gender perspectives<br>
<br>
<br>
The COVID-19 pandemic provides an opportunity for radical, positive action to redress long-standing inequalities in multiple areas of women’s lives, and build a more just and resilient world. <br>
